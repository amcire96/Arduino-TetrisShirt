Tetris Shirt
------------
Arduino code that implements a Tetris game on a 20x10 LED grid.
The code includes aspects of Bill Porter's LED Tetris Necktie Arduino code.

The algorithm to that the shirt uses to play the game is based off of Islam El-Ashi's algorithm.
I first coded this algorithm into my Java Tetris project (https://github.com/amcire96/Java-TetrisAI).
